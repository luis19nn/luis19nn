    <summary>A little about me:</summary>
    <br>
    <p>I started in the field in 2019 when I joined UFPR, and I chose this area because it seemed difficult and because I love technology. Since I was a child, I have been more excited and interested in subjects considered more difficult, such as in school, where I paid much more attention in classes when I heard someone complaining about the content. I always thought "if it's difficult, I need to know, I need to learn."</p>
    <p>In addition, I have always enjoyed helping others around me, whether by clarifying doubts about the content before a test, or by going beyond my part in the assignments. My philosophy is that we should all assist each other, help each other more, and be more altruistic, and one of the things that makes me love technology is the possibility of helping others with it. Through apps that make life easier, websites with great user experiences that enable stress-free navigation for a busy consumer, or even automating repetitive tasks so that we can focus on the really important things.</p>
    <p>In 2022, I started my first experience in the field, and I have been learning a lot about how a technology company works, what the day-to-day and task delivery is like, and, mainly, I learn about technology in practice and in depth. I use technologies like Python, Django, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Mongo, Docker, GraphQL, REST, Microservices, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and many others daily at work. In college, I learn about Java, Spring, JPA, Hibernate, Design Patterns, Data Structures, Databases, and much more.</p>
    <p>Therefore, today I have the confidence that I want to pursue a career in software development to positively impact our society, even if on a small scale, dealing with daily challenges and working to grow professionally while assisting those around me and also while asking for help from more experienced individuals because no one can do everything alone.</p>
